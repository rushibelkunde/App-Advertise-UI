This README.md file provides an overview of an assignment I completed using ReactJS, GreenSock (GSAP), and Tailwind CSS. In this assignment, I was tasked with cloning a provided website and incorporating animations. Due to time constraints, I was able to complete approximately some part of the assignment. 

## Assignment Description

The assignment involved the following technologies and tasks:

- **ReactJS**: I used ReactJS as the frontend library for building the user interface and managing the application's components.

- **GreenSock (GSAP)**: I integrated GSAP for creating animations within the assignment. While I had to research and learn GSAP during the assignment, I successfully incorporated some animations to enhance the user experience.

- **Tailwind CSS**: I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling and layout, ensuring that the cloned website closely resembled the provided design.

## Assignment Progress

As mentioned earlier, I was able to complete approximately some part of the assignment within the given two-day timeframe. The completed parts of the assignment include:

- Cloning and structuring the website's basic layout using React components.
- Implementing responsive design and styling using Tailwind CSS.
- Integrating animations using GreenSock (GSAP) to add engaging interactions to the website.

## Remaining Work

Due to time limitations, the following tasks remain unfinished:

- Completion of the remaining website sections or pages.
- Additional animations and interactions to enhance the user experience.
- Refactoring and optimizing the codebase for performance and maintainability.

## Usage Instructions

To run the completed portion of the assignment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
